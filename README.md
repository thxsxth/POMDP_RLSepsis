# Reinforcement Learning based 'Learning' of Dynamic Sepsis Treatment Strategies

## Still work in progress
#### To do
1. Try to Model the enviroment, Using Deep Markov Models, Structured Inference Networks+ RNNs and mechanistic CardioVascular Models.
2. Use Graphical Neural Networks
3. Try the Reinforcement Learning/Control




### Data
Open [mimic] database was used as the data source. Relationships of the schema can be found [here][schema].

Most of the preprocessing was done on Google Big Query Mimic-iii project,and preprocessed and cleansed using SQL on Big Query and Pandas.
