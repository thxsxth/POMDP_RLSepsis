### The Notebook Distributional_DQN.ipynb contains the C51 algorithm and training
Training is just a straightforward application of the c51 algorithm using previously infered hidden states.

Validation distributions shown at the end of this notebook was used only to evaluate the fit of training value distributions in different epochs, but wasn't used for any results in the paper.

#### Note: Also included are other RL algorithms used for previous experiments, these were not used for final work and may contain some errors
