The following image illustrates the archiecture of the physiology driven autoencoder. The mechanistic model is a set of algebriac equations derived by analytically solving 2 parameter lumped Windkessell ODE. 

The notebook \textbf{Physiology_informed_Sequential_AutoEncoder_(With_Denoising).ipynb} presents training of thee physiologic model. load_and_process deals with the imports processing and defines the dataset and dataloader classes.
